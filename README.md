This is a simple application built on React Native to demonstrate a variety of different components/tools. The both of us (Sam Lee and Jeff Gao) have developed with React in the past and wanted to explore how similar this was.

## App

This project incorporates the various things outlined in the basic Facebook React [tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/tutorial.html). Additionally, the template for the project was generated using [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

## Contributions

The majority of this project was partner coded, with the two of us taking turns writing the code for changes we made. 

## Difficulties

We ran into some initial trouble creating and running the React Native project. One workaround we needed was runing ```yarn start``` rather than ```npm start``` which the tutorial suggested.
